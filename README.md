# TestLogTime
To check just how fast Logarithmic time is, in comparison with linear time. Tests are run on finding Fibonacci numbers. 

## Usage
Run the file in any Python environment. The only variable is the upper limit of test. You could give the limit as 10000
and it would run tests for 1, 10, 100, 10000 and 100000. Basically the mutliple of 10s, including the limit.

It's a pretty simple piece of code which you can manipulate as you deem fit. Have fun!
